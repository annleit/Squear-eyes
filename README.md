# Squear-eyes
I lost my draft and had to start again. I have been working om my file every free hour, every day this week and I have learned a lot, but unfortnuatly I have not found the ultimate solution. The page is somewhat resposive, but in the prosess of getting it resposive I have not been able to finish the design 100%. A couple of pages with input forms I have hidden the CSS on purpose while due to problem with the forms and CSS it looks better without CSS at the moment. I have to take this CSS journey I on as a learning process.

Sincerely 
Anne Leitre
